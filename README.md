## Instructions to setup and run project
To set up this project you need to first install terminal dependencies, which include mongoose, axios, express,nodemon, and basic npm install. After successfully downloading these you must change directories into the server directory and run a scrip known as init.js to initiliaze and populate the database. Make sure to run mongod in another terminal window prior to this. After running the command "nodemon init.js 'yourUsername' 'yourPassowrd'", control c or kill the program after it has finished and then run "npm start" to start ther server. After this open another terminal and change directories to client and then run npm start there as well to get the front end running.
